## Overview

**Project Title**: Task-Master

**Project Description**: A "To-Do-List program in C++

**Project Goals**: My goals where to build a program in C++ that include these requirements: conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map), in this case it was a vector.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the C++ extensions in VS code
2. Download a compiler
3. Set up the develepmental envrionment

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program by clicking the play button if you are on VS code
2. Type your name in the prompt after it asks you
3. After it takes you to the main menu, put where you want to go by typing in the corresponding number next to the option
4. After you are finsihed with the section you are in type "done" to take you back to the main menu
5. When you are completely finished with the program type 4 to exit 

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* C++ extensions
* GCC complier

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* W3 Schools - https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/
*   I utilized this resource the most, it has a lot of amazing documentation on commands and how the syntax works in the language.
* ChatGPT - https://chatgpt.com/
*   I utilized this resource to help me discover some commands that were not documented in W3 Schools, for example it helped me discover a simple command that would ignore the cin input before a user inputs a value for the variable which helped me fix a bug in my code. The command was called "cin.ignore();" I also had help with other commands as well, but that was my biggest issure I ran into.
* Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=3s
*   I didn't utilize this resource as much as I orignial planned because of how much I enjoyed W3 School's C++ tutorial, I think I watched part of one video and didn't really incorpate what I watched into the this project, nonetheless I still wanted to cite it.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Really the only thing I could think of to make this improved would be adding a file that it saves the data too, which would allow you to load a previous list that you have already filled out.
* [ ] This one is really shooting for the stars, but if I could add a graphical representation of the code, like into a webpage, or app that would be neat.
